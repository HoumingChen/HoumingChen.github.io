<p>At present, I’m a junior undergraduate student at the
<a href="https://umich.edu">University of Michigan</a> - Ann Arbor, majoring in
<a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/lsa/academics/majors-minors/computer-science-major.html">computer science</a> and
<a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/math/undergraduates/major-and-minor-programs/honors-mathematics.html">honor mathematics</a>.
I’m also working as a research assistant at
<a href="https://pdhillon.com">Dr. Paramveer Dhillon’s</a> research group in
<a href="https://www.si.umich.edu">School of Information at the University of Michigan</a>.</p>

<h2 id="researches">Researches</h2>
<p>I’m currently working as a research assistant at Dr. Paramveer Dhillon’s research group. This group mainly research on topics in computational social science. Some projects that I’m currently working with involves applying NLP and data mining techniques to social media data to study some social science problems. (Details will be available soon)</p>

<p>When I was taking EECS545 , four other students and I had completed a project in which we proposed a new method to find interpretable latent directions in GANs. (Details will be available soon)</p>

<h2 id="academic-interest">Academic Interest</h2>
<p>My interest lies broadly in math and computer science. At present, I am most interested in the theory and application of deep learning. I’m shocked by scientists’ current achievements in deep learning.</p>

<p>Among a variety of exciting areas of deep learning, I’m currently most interested in NLP, multimodels, and interpretability of neural networks.</p>
