<p><em>I’m writing a short blog to see if math formulas could be show correctly.</em></p>

<h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>
<p>Tomorrow is 12/29. It would be cool if I can come up with some math questions whose answers are 1229.</p>

<p>A more general problem would be: given an integer \(x\), how can we find an interesting math question whose answer is exactly \(x\).</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="what-questions-are-interesting">What questions are interesting?</h3>
<p>It is very easy to construct a simple question whose answer is 1229. For example 
\[\text{What is the value of } 723 + 506 \text{?}\]</p>

<p>However, this question is not interesting enough, It is <em>easy</em>, since it can be solved by simple calculation. It is also <em>not elegant</em>, because there are two strange numbers “726” and “506” which seems coming from nowhere.</p>

<p>However, could we find some questions which are more interesting?</p>

<p>How about this:
\[\text{How many prime numbers are less than } 10000 \text{?}\]</p>

<p>This question cannot be solved instantly, and there are not any strange numbers or formulas in the question.</p>

<p>You might find it surprising that the answer of this question is indeed 1229. You can check this by this one-line python code.</p>

<h3 id="how-could-we-find-those-interesting-questions">How could we find those interesting questions?</h3>

<p>This is the key part of this blog.</p>

<p>The trick is to use a website called <a href="https://oeis.org/"> The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences</a>, or simply <a href="https://oeis.org/">OEIS</a></p>

<p>This is a website which stores many integer sequences. It also allows you to search for interesting sequences with a given number or some given numbers.</p>
