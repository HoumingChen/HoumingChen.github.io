    At present, I'm a senior undergraduate student at the
    <a href="https://umich.edu">University of Michigan</a>
    - Ann Arbor, majoring in
    <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/lsa/academics/majors-minors/computer-science-major.html">computer science</a>
    and
    <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/math/undergraduates/major-and-minor-programs/honors-mathematics.html">honor mathematics</a>.

    I'm also working in professor <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~jag/">Dr. H.V. Jagadish's</a> research group and closely working with professor <a href="https://in.bgu.ac.il/en/Pages/Yuval-Moskovitch.aspx">Dr. Yuval Moskovitch</a>.

    <h3>Researches</h3>
  </header>

   <p>
    I'm currently working as a research assistant at <a href="https://pdhillon.com">Dr. H.V. Jagadish's</a> research group. I am researching on a data mining research project under <a href="https://pdhillon.com">Dr. H.V. Jagadish</a> and <a href="https://in.bgu.ac.il/en/Pages/Yuval-Moskovitch.aspx">Dr. Yuval Moskovitch</a>.

   </p>

    Before I joined <a href="https://pdhillon.com">Dr. H.V. Jagadish's</a> research group, I was in professor <a href="https://pdhillon.com">Dr. Paramveer Dhillon's</a> research group, where I closely working with professor Dr. Paramveer Dhillon, <a href="https://yulin-yu.github.io/">Yulin Yu</a>, and professor <a href="http://www.dromero.org/">Dr. Daniel Romero</a>. We conducted a computational social science research which involves applying NLP and data mining techniques to Twitter data to study some social science problems. The paper have been submitted to the The ACM Web Conference and is under review now. (Details will be available soon)

    When I was taking
    <a href="https://ece.engin.umich.edu/academics/course-information/course-descriptions/eecs-545/">EECS545</a>
    , four other students and I had completed a project in which we proposed
    a new method to find interpretable latent directions in GANs.
    (Details will be available soon)

    <h3>Academic Interest</h3>
  </header>
  <p>
    My interest lies broadly in math and computer science. At present, I'm now especially interested in the application of deep learning
    in NLP and multimodel tasks, interpretability of neural networks, explanations for the excellent generalizability
    of neural networks, and the relationship between deep learning and cognitive science.
