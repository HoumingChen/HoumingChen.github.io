    <h3>Academic Interest</h3>
  </header>
  <p>
    My interest lies broadly in math and computer science. At present, I am most interested in
    the theory and application of deep learning. Among the variety of exciting areas of deep learning,
    I'm currently most interested in NLP, multimodels, and the interpretability of neural networks.

    <h3>Researches</h3>
  </header>
  <p>
    I'm currently working as a research assistant at <a href="https://pdhillon.com">Dr. Paramveer
    Dhillon's</a> research group. This group mainly research on topics in computational
    social science.

    Some projects that I'm currently working with involves
    applying NLP and data mining techniques to social media data to study some
    social science problems. (Details will be available soon)

    When I was taking
    <a href="https://ece.engin.umich.edu/academics/course-information/course-descriptions/eecs-545/">EECS545</a>
    , four other students and I had completed a project in which we proposed
    a new method to find interpretable latent directions in GANs.
    (Details will be available soon)
